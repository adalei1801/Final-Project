    <p>
      There are some writing conventions you are used to that are not applicable in formal writing. For example, contractions, or the combining and shortening of two or more words with an apostrophe to create a shorthand version of the used words. The lack of proper puncuation among other common practices in text lingo cannot be used in formal writing as well. This section will provide the do's and do not's in formal writng using examples and definitions in a clear and concise way and any further questions can be answered in the "Resources" section of this guide.
