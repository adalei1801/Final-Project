         The "Do's and Do Not's" section of this guide detailed some sections of components of formal writing, which will be discussed here. Parts of formal writing like complex sentences, vocabulary, punctuation, etc.

        <h3>Defining The Small Things</h3>
        <dl>
          <dt>Complex Sentences</dt>
          <dd>Complex sentences combine two independent, non-complex sentences with a conjunction.
          Note: There are 4 types of sentences. They are: declarative, imperative, interrogative, exclamatory. 
           <ol>
             <li>&bull;a sentence that makes a statement. Uses period.</li>
             <li>&bull; Imperative: a sentence that issues a command. Uses a period or exclamation mark.</li>
             <li>&bull; Interrogative: a sentence that asks a question. Uses a question mark.</li>
             <li>&bull; Exclamatory: a sentence that projects strong feelings. Uses an exclamation mark.</li>
           </ol>
          </dd>

          <dt>Vocabulary</dt>
          <dd>The words used in a language. Formal writing mandates complex and varied language.</dd>

          <dt>Point of View</dt>
          <dd>The position from which something is told.
            
            Note: There are several positions to write from, but formal writing uses a third-person point of view which is when the narrator exists outside of the story and calls the characters by name or pronoun. Examples include he/him, she/her, they/them, etc.</dd>

          <dt>Contraction</dt>
          <dd>When two or more words are combined and shortened using an apostrophe.</dd>

          <dt>Conjunction</dt>
          <dd>A word is used to connect sentences or clauses. Some examples include: but, and, because, although, since, yet, etc.
          
          There are 4 types of conjunctions; coordinating, correlative, subordinating, and conjunctive adverbs.
            <ol>
               <li>&bull; Coordinating Conjunction: a word that connects two sentences or clauses of equal importance. Examples of this conjunction are: for, and, nor, but, or, yet, and so.</li>
               <li>&bull; Correlative Conjunction: a pair of words that join sentences or clauses. Examples of these conjunctions are both...and, either...or, neither...nor, etc.</li>
               <li>&bull; Subordinating Conjunction: conjunction that joins a dominant and subordinate sentence or clause. Examples of subordinating conjunctions are although, because, since, etc.</li>
               <li>&bull; Conjunctive Adverb: conjunction that connects two independent sentences or clauses. Examples include: nevertheless, thus, hence, etc.</li>
             </ol>
          </dd>
