       <td colspan="2"> Note: There are several postitions to write from, but formal writing uses third person point of view which is when the narrator exists outside of the story and calls the characters by name or pronoun. Examples include: he/him, she/her, they/them, etc.</td>

         <td>Contraction</td>
         <td>When two or more words are combined and shorthened using an apostrophe.</td>

           <td>Conjunction</td>
           <td>A word used to connect sentences or clauses together. Some examples include: but, and, because, although, since, yet, etc.</td>

         <td colspan="2">Note: There are 4 types of conjuntions; coordinating, correlative, subordinating, and conjunctive adverbs. 
           <ol>
             <li>&bull; Coordinating Conjunction: a word that connects two sentences or clauses of equal importance. Examples of this conjunction are: for, and, nor, but, or, yet, and so.</li>
             <li>&bull; Correlative Conjunction: a pair of words that join sentences or clauses. Examples of these conjunctions are both...and, either...or, neither...nor, etc.</li>
             <li>&bull; Subordinating Conjunction: a conjunction that joins a dominate and subordinate sentence or clause. Examples of subordinating conjunctions are although, because, since, etc.</li>
             <li>&bull; Conjunctive Adverb: a cojunction that connects two independent sentences or clauses together. Examples include: nevertheless, thus, hence, etc.</li>
