        <p>Formal writing is defined as "a form of writing which is used for the business, legal, academic or professional purpose" by Key Differences. Formal writing also adheres to Standard Conventional English which includes emphasis on grammar, punctuation, sentence structure, etc. Formal writing also needs complex sentences or sentences that utilize conjunctions to join two independent, but connected sentences or clauses into one. Language is also a central part of formal writing because as previously stated formal writing adheres to Standard Conventional English which means no colloquialism(slang), contractions(shortening words using an apostrophe, for example, the words "do not" in contraction form is don't). Understanding the core sections of English is integral for proper formal writing.</p>
